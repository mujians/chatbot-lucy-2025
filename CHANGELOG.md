#### Security Audits Completed
- **XSS Protection** (#SEC-2) - ✅ VERIFIED SECURE
  - Widget uses `escapeHtml()` with `textContent` auto-escape
  - All user input sanitized before rendering

  - No vulnerabilities found

- **Session Expiry** (#SEC-1) - ✅ ALREADY IMPLEMENTED
  - 7-day TTL on client (localStorage)
  - Server-side validation with HTTP 410 response
  - Auto-cleanup of expired sessions

- **SessionId Ownership** (#SEC-3) - ⚠️ DOCUMENTED
  - Public endpoints don't validate ownership

#### Documentation
- Created comprehensive `SECURITY_AUDIT_REPORT.md`

### 🔄 Changed

### ⚠️ Known Issues / Limitations

#### Pending User Decision
- **UX-4**: "Apri Ticket" on operator disconnect
  - Question: Keep or remove ticket option when operator disconnects?
  - Current: Shows [Apri Ticket] [Continua con AI] [Valuta]
  - Options: A) Keep (useful if operator offline), B) Remove (might reconnect)
  - Effort: 5 minutes

#### Documented Acceptable Risks
- **SEC-3**: SessionId Ownership Validation
  - Public endpoints don't validate session ownership
  - Risk: LOW (UUID hard to guess, limited attack value)
  - Impact: LOW-MEDIUM (can disrupt chat, can't access history)
  - Acceptable for MVP, can add sessionToken later (2-3 hours)
