## üêõ Known Issues / Limitations

### Limitation 1: Preference Reload Timing
**Issue**: Notification service loads preferences on construction only. Changes saved in Settings will apply on:
- Next page reload
- Next notification event (preferences re-checked per event)

**Workaround**: Preferences are checked per-event, so they apply correctly. Just no immediate feedback in console.

**Priority**: Low (works correctly, just delayed logging)

---

### Limitation 2: Widget Audio Autoplay Policy
**Issue**: Browsers block audio autoplay until user interaction
**Solution**: Implemented audio unlock on first message send
**Status**: Working as designed
